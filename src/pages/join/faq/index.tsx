        Prior experience is not required, as long as you are{" "}
        <i>passionate to learn about Robotics!</i> Although it may seem daunting
        initially, with hard work, dedication and open-mindedness throughout the training
        provided, you can definitely succeed here! There are many of us here who also did not take
        Robotics in Primary School.

      "What competitions does Robotics @APEX participate in? Are they sufficient for LEAPS 2.0?",
    answer: (

        <p>
          In Robotics @APEX, we use a variety of systems including LEGO, MakeX,
          VEX, Arduino and Raspberry Pi. Each system has its own array of
          competitions and categories to participate in such as First LEGO
          League (FLL) or MakeX Championships. Additionally, we also participate
          in broader, more open competitions such as the renowned National
          Robotics Competition or RoboCup. An exhaustive list of all
          competitions we have won an award in can be found on the{" "}

        </p>
        <p>
          In Robotics @APEX, you will be given ample opportunities to participate in a
          myriad of competitions and{" "}
          <b>guaranteed (and mandated) at least one per year</b>. Hence, it is
          highly unlikely you would be unable to meet the requirements of{" "}

          which is to represent the school at an event for 3 years or more
          (Level 4 for Representation).
